## Q1
In this challenge, the author has created an array of bytes (byteArray) and assigns values to the first 101 elements of the array. It then adds 3 to each element in the array using a For loop to perform a ceaser cipher. The ConvertByteArrayToString subroutine converts the byte array to a string using the 'StrConv' function with the 'vbUnicode' argument, which converts the byte array to a string using the Unicode character set. It then displays a message box with the resulting string, which is a cryptic message. By changing the number of value of the ceaser cipher from 3 to 10 you will be able to find the correct string.
