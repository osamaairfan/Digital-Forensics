Here are some commonly used characters for creating masks in Hashcat:

    ?l: This represents a lowercase letter (a-z).
    ?u: This represents an uppercase letter (A-Z).
    ?d: This represents a digit (0-9).
    ?s: This represents a special character, such as !, @, or #.
    ?a: This represents any character (lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, or special character).

Here are some examples of how to use masks in Hashcat:

    ?l?l?l: This mask will generate all possible combinations of three lowercase letters.
    ?u?l?d?d: This mask will generate all possible combinations of an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and two digits.
    ?l?l?l?l?d?d: This mask will generate all possible combinations of four lowercase letters followed by two digits.
