## Q2
By using `'john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=raw-sha512 hash.txt'` the password hash has successfully been loaded.

> The -1 ?u?d?l?s flag specifies that the first character must be an uppercase letter, digit, lowercase letter, or symbol, while -2 ?d?d specifies that the next two characters must be digits. Similarly, -3 ?l specifies that the fourth character must be a lowercase letter, -4 ?s specifies that the fifth character must be a symbol, and -i specifies that the attack should be case-insensitive.

## Q4
I created a python script to perform hash salting in the given hash:

**Salted Password**: ``'16c5b239b86531789a90776263ef292722465c0f8466fd2a9bf92d441e40a03e'``

By using `'john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=raw-sha256 hash.txt'` the password hash has been cracked.
> **Password:** `"Â¡Vamos!"`

## Q5
By using hashcat the password has been cracked:
> **Password:** `"7484c9a3d50e649f50411c58317eb7c6c6e506a94b04ebb87dd8715ce16de0d8e41a4894f9be4bbc7dbc204e1f7103e7b75844f78ce288f89befdfb53f9f5ac8:Michael1997_scooby"`

### For the learning purpose:

Here are some commonly used characters for creating masks in Hashcat:

    ?l: This represents a lowercase letter (a-z).
    ?u: This represents an uppercase letter (A-Z).
    ?d: This represents a digit (0-9).
    ?s: This represents a special character, such as !, @, or #.
    ?a: This represents any character (lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, or special character).

Here are some examples of how to use masks in Hashcat:

    ?l?l?l: This mask will generate all possible combinations of three lowercase letters.
    ?u?l?d?d: This mask will generate all possible combinations of an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and two digits.
    ?l?l?l?l?d?d: This mask will generate all possible combinations of four lowercase letters followed by two digits.
