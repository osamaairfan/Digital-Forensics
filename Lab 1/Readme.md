Q1) ls

Q2) cat

Q3) grep

Q4) md5sum, sha1sum

Q5) The command will return output like below:

/usr/bin/cat: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=

This output tells us that the file /usr/bin/cat is an ELF file, which stands for Executable and Linkable Format. It's a 64-bit LSB shared object, built for x86-64 architecture, version 1 (SYSV) and it's dynamically linked to interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, which is for GNU/Linux 3.2.0.

Q6) string -n 8 /bin/bash

Q7) The file "image.jpg" is not of the correct format. According to the output of the "file" command, it is an ELF 64-bit executable file, not a JPEG image file. The ".jpg" extension is typically used for image files in the JPEG format, but the actual contents of the file are not in that format. That’s why it is not working.

Q8) find /home -mmin -30

Q9) netstat –ta

Q10) flag{d1g1tal_f0r3ns1cs_101}
