## Q5
The /usr/bin/cat command is used to display the contents of one or more files on the terminal window. The output generated by the cat command depends on the file or files that are specified as arguments to the command.

## Q6 
> **string -n 8 /bin/bash**

## Q7 
The file "image.jpg" is not of the correct format. According to the output of the "file" command, it is an ELF 64-bit executable file, not a JPEG image file. The ".jpg" extension is typically used for image files in the JPEG format, but the actual contents of the file are not in that format. That’s why it is not working.

## Q9

## Q10
This image file can be restored by changing the first four magic bytes by using hexedit command.
